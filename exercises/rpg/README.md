A role-player game created using vanilla Javascript and Node.js.
It's meant to be played within Node, so if you have it installed please give it a whirl!
Otherwise, thank you for checking out my code!

The premise is that you are an adventurous traveler making a journey to the promised land. On your journey you will meet with enemies and you can choose how to face them. Prizes are rewarded upon defeating enemies, but beware that they are highly difficult to gather.

Good luck on your journey!
